# Covid-Cases-Analysis-In-India-USA
Data Science And Analysis Using Python

The Following Project Is The Analysis Between U.S.A And India.
In This Project There Is The Comparision Between Different States Of USA And India And Also We Have Compared Two Countries For Number Of Beds Present, Total Population Of That Place And How The Facilities Are Provided In That Particular Region Which We Can Use To Calculate The Fatality RateDue To COVID.

# My final Conclusion about the project :
> From the analysis of the above data we can say tha in the countris like India needs to increase the number of beds in country at drastic rates. Since the number of beds are low and population is high so this is the alarming condition for India.
> While in case of U.S.A sufficient amount of  beds are present.
